# Saligao-Dust-Busters

Considering the unpleasant odor permeating Saligoa, a village in Goa, we have developed this website to provide users with information about dustbin locations displayed on an interactive map.
Additionally, users can stay updated on dustbin cleaning activities.

Users can file complaints regarding various issues in the village, such as potholes, overflowing dustbins, roadkill, and water supply problems. Moreover, users are encouraged to provide suggestions to address these concerns.

Furthermore, we are in the process of developing a donation page on our website. This feature allows users to contribute items like clothes, books, and food, which will later be distributed to those in need.

We also have a dedicated page on our website that offers news updates about the village. This page covers various topics such as accidents, traffic jams, water and electricity disruptions, as well as cleanliness drives and panchayat meetings. 
Stay informed about the latest happenings in Saligao through our news section.

Lastly, our website provides localized weather reports specifically for Saligao, ensuring users are well-informed about the weather conditions in the area.
